⚠️ DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ⚠️

This entire directory is GENERATED during the build process.

Build process:
1. sync:model copies _model/ → sites/{community}/
2. sync:model copies _overrides/{community}/ → sites/{community}/ (overlaying model)
3. lume builds sites/ → _site/

To make changes:
- Shared content → Edit files in _model/
- Community-specific content → Edit files in _overrides/{community}/
- Then run: deno task build

All files in sites/ are gitignored and will be overwritten on next build.
